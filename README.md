Short program to **sort strings** (stdin) **by weight** (sum of chars in string).

This is **completely useless** but serves as a simple showcase of C including its *typedefs, structs, macros, loops, and syntax abuse.*


How it works:
```
$ wsort XYZ abc ABCD ... 123

... 	[46 46 46]	->	138
123 	[49 50 51]	->	150
ABCD 	[65 66 67 68]	->	266
XYZ 	[88 89 90]	->	267
abc 	[97 98 99]	->	294
```
